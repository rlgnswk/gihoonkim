# Welcome

I am a Ph.D. student in Data Science at **Seoul National University**, advised by **Prof. Taesup Kim** (Learning Adaptation Algorithm Lab).
My research focuses on **personalized diffusion models**—especially how to maintain identity/attribute consistency while preventing *distributional drift* during personalization. I am also interested in **multimodal generative modeling** (text-to-image, video generation) and **controllable generation**.

Previously, I received my M.S. from **KAIST** (Culture Technology; Visual Media Lab, advised by Prof. Junyong Noh), and I worked as a research intern at **NAVER CLOVA** in Image/Vision, where I developed 3D-aware generative pipelines (e.g., 3D-consistent hairstyle transfer).
