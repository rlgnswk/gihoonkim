I am a Ph.D. student in Data Science at **Seoul National University**, advised by **Prof. Taesup Kim** (Learning Adaptation Algorithm Lab).
My research broadly studies **diffusion models**—their learning and inference mechanisms, guidance/control behaviors, and how these translate into practical capabilities for generative modeling.
Within this direction, I am particularly interested in **personalized diffusion**, aiming to maintain identity/attribute consistency while preventing *distributional drift* during adaptation, as well as **multimodal generation** (text-to-image, video). Previously, I received my M.S. from KAIST (Visual Media Lab) and my B.S. from Handong University. I also worked as a research intern at NAVER CLOVA.

- **Multimodal Generative Modeling**
  - text-to-image generation
  - video generation
- **Controllable Generation**
  - guidance and control for targeted edits/attributes
  - diffusion for inverse problems
